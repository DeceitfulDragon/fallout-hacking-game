# Fallout Terminal Hacking Minigame

## Introduction

This project is a recreation of the iconic terminal hacking minigame from the Fallout series (specifically Fallout 4) developed using HTML, CSS, and JS to allow for playing on the web!

## How to Play

The goal of the game is to find the correct password hidden in a list of possible words. Each attempt will provide feedback on how many letters of the selected word match the correct password in the correct position. This feedback is called the "likeness" score.
For example: if the correct word is DANGER, then picking HUNTER would have a likeness of 3 (As the letters "N, E, R" are in the exact same places in both words)
So keep in mind that the letter AND its position in the word matters.

## ToDo
- Make sure that duds work
- Get a proper list of words for all difficulties
- Add some functionality for changing selected difficulty
- Animation / aesthetic for terminal scan lines and jittery text
- Sound? I wanna use Fallout 4's actual sound files but that's probably not gonna fly
- Add some kind of terminal menu once you do hack it, maybe allow for journal entries that can be stored locally
